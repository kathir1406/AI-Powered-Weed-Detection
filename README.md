# AI-Powered Weed Detection and Removal

## Overview
This project implements an AI-powered agricultural robot that detects and removes weeds using computer vision. The system processes real-time camera feed, identifies weeds using color-based image detection, and simulates robotic arm movement for weed removal.

## Features
- 🌱 **Real-time Weed Detection**: Uses OpenCV to analyze the camera feed and detect green-colored weeds.
- 🤖 **Simulated Robotic Arm**: Prints weed locations and simulates removal.
- 🖥️ **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with Tkinter for ease of use.
- 🎥 **Live Video Feed**: Displays the camera feed in real-time.

## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script to launch the application:
```sh
python main.py
```
### Controls
- **Start**: Begins weed detection.
- **Stop**: Stops detection (feature to be implemented).
- **Quit**: Closes the application.

## Future Enhancements
- ✅ Implement a real robotic arm for weed removal.
- ✅ Enhance detection accuracy using machine learning models.
- ✅ Add more control options like pause/resume detection.

🚜 **Happy Farming with AI!** 🌾
